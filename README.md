# gridle.cc - Guess That Grid! 


## gridle.cc

The website, a static TypeScript site built with React and NextJS.  


## Data Generation 

Python scripts which generate the json files containing all the data needed by the application. This component pulls 
a huge amount of data from The Blue Alliance so initially running the scripts will take a while, but after the first 
run data is cached locally.
